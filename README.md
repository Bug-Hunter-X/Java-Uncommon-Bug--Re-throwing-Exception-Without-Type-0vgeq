This repository demonstrates a subtle Java error: re-throwing a caught exception without specifying its type.  The code throws an ArithmeticException (division by zero), catches it, and then re-throws it generically. Although seemingly functional, this can make debugging and handling the exception more difficult, especially for higher levels of the call stack that may be expecting a specific exception type for their error handling.
